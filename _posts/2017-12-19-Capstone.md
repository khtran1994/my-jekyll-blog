This post is about my capstone
- **Simple**- make building and maintaing websites incredibly simple, easier to maintain ( no database, no server-side scripts)
-**fast**-statuc files can ve served fast. There is no database or templating layer that slows down requests.
-**Secure**- as they do not contain dynamic content
-uses **markdown**
-**previewable**- because static sites are developed locally, you can play around with the site to your heart's content without affecting the slive site.
